    fbo:description "In a game of little tactical quality, Andre Onana against the Liverpool press stood out as where the match might be won or lost. The Cameroon international started building up short, but quickly went to longer passes, particularly into wide areas, against an intense 4-4-2 Liverpool press. While Liverpool have peaked later in games this season, they have shown their ability to suffocate their opponents from the off, such as in the 3-0 Anfield win over Aston Villa. Onana was not particularly consistent with his long passes, overhitting some out of play, but had moments of picking out United forwards which ought to have led to better attacks. A total of 71.4 per cent of his first-half passes went long (35+ yards); it was well above his all-competition average this season (42.3 per cent).Another tactical point was Liverpool’s switch to a 4-2-4, moving Alexander-Arnold into midfield permanently. It gave United more space to drop passes over the midfield and play through, which Klopp rectified with his second set of substitutes. United’s best chance of the game, with Rasmus Hojlund shooting straight at Alisson one-v-one, came from a driven Onana pass into Antony, who could set Scott McTominay to release the No 9." ;

    fbo:description "Liverpool moved three points clear at the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 4-2 win over Newcastle United. All six goals at Anfield came in a breathless second half. Mohamed Salah made amends for a missed penalty with his 150th Liverpool Premier League goal, before Alexander Isak equalised against the run of play with Newcastle’s first shot on target. Liverpool scored twice in quick succession to make it 3-1, and although Sven Botman’s header set up a nervy finish, Salah converted a second spot-kick of the match to go joint-top of the Premier League scoring charts this season. Newcastle s Martin Dubravka was in incredible form, ending the match with 10 saves, the joint-most by any goalkeeper in a fixture this season, as Liverpool racked up 7.27 Expected Goals, the highest total on record by a team in a single Premier League match." ;
